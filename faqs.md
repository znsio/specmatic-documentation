Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

### What is "Contract First"?

Specmatic requires you to author the contract first which is then leveraged to run Provider Stubs and Contract Tests.

More on this [here](/contract_testing.html#specmatic---contract-first).

### Does Specmatic work with all programming languages?

Yes, Specmatic can work with any language / tech stack in [command line](/documentation/command_line.html) mode.
Example: Refer this [section](/documentation/getting_started.html#provider-side---contract-as-a-test) where we run Specmatic test on a Ruby Sinatra application.

At the moment [programmatic support](/documentation/getting_started_programmatically.html) is only available to JVM languages.
We are working on adding support for more languages and VMs.

### How much code do I have to write to get Specmatic running?

Zero, if you are adopting the [command_line](/documentation/command_line.html) approach.
If you need IDE support, you have to write a few lines of code to get it going.
