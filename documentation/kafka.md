# Starting Kafka Mock Server from command line

Create a file named `specmatic.yaml` with below content.

```yaml
#specmatic.yaml
sources:
  - provider: git
    repository: https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-contracts.git
    consumes:
      - io/specmatic/examples/store/asyncapi/kafka.yaml
```

This file instructs Specmatic to pull the [AsyncAPI spec named `kafka.yaml`](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-contracts/blob/main/io/specmatic/examples/store/asyncapi/kafka.yaml) from a Git repo. The AsyncAPI spec itself has the details regarding Kafka topics, schema, etc.

Please refer to [Specmatic documentation](https://specmatic.in/documentation/) for more details about the above `specmatic.yaml` config file.

Now we can run below command to spin a Kafka mock server. Please note the volume mapping to pass the specmatic.yaml to the Kafka Docker image and also the port mappings.

```shell
docker run -p 9092:9092 -p 2181:2181 -p 29092:29092 -v "$PWD/specmatic.yaml:/usr/src/app/specmatic.yaml" znsio/specmatic-kafka-trial
```
This should produce logs that shows that Specmatic Kafka server has started and listening on topics.

```bash
Setting up listeners
Listening on topics: (product-queries)
```

This command also starts an API server to interact with the mock server on the default port 29092.
```bash
Starting api server on port:29092
```

The API server can be started on a port other than 29092 by passing the desired port via `--mock-server-api-port` CLI argument as follows.
```shell
docker run -p 9092:9092 -p 2181:2181 -p 3000:3000 -v "$PWD/specmatic.yaml:/usr/src/app/specmatic.yaml" znsio/specmatic-kafka-trial --mock-server-api-port=3000
```

## Interacting with the API server

The API server provides endpoints to interact with the kafka mock server, allowing you to perform the following actions:
1. Set Expectations: Configure the Kafka mock server with specific expectations.
2. Verify Expectations: Check if the expectations set for the Kafka mock server have been met.

Here is the OpenAPI specification for these endpoints. Please refer to it for comprehensive information on how to utilize these endpoints.
```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0

  title: Specmatic Kafka Mock Server API

```

# Running Contract Tests Against a Kafka-Based Request-Reply Service

Create a service which implements the kafka messaging architecture as per the [order_service_async.yaml](https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-contracts/blob/main/io/specmatic/examples/store/asyncapi/order_service_async_v1.yaml) specification.

This service will use a Kafka consumer to listen to the `place-order` topic, and upon receiving a message, it will publish one message each to the `process-order` and `notification` topics. This architecture pattern is known as the request-reply pattern.

### Service Implementation
1. Consumer: Listens to the place-order topic.
2. Producer: Publish messages to process-order and notification topics.

### Specmatic Configuration
Create a specmatic.yaml configuration file to specify the contract for the service:
```yaml
sources:
- provider: "git"
  repository: "https://github.com/znsio/specmatic-order-contracts.git"
  provides:
  - "io/specmatic/examples/store/asyncapi/order_service_async_v1.yaml"
```
This configuration informs Specmatic that the service provides the implementation as per the specification listed under the provides key. This setup allows Specmatic to run tests against the service using the provided spec.

### Testing the Service
To test this service from the command line, follow the below steps.
1. **Start Kafka Broker**: Launch a local instance of the Kafka broker on the desired host and port.
2. **Run the Service**: Start your service locally.
3. **Run Contract Tests**: Use the following command to run the contract tests against the service by replacing `kafka_broker_host` and `kafka_broker_port` with appropriate values:
```shell
docker run --network="host" -v "$PWD/specmatic.yaml:/usr/src/app/specmatic.yaml" znsio/specmatic-kafka-trial test --host=<kafka_broker_host> --port=<kafka_broker_port>
```

To get information around all the CLI args of the `test` command, run the following command.
```shell
docker run znsio/specmatic-kafka-trial test --help
```
