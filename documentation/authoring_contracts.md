## From an existing application using proxy mode

\
![](/images/specmatic-reverse-proxy.svg)

Specmatic acts as a transparent proxy between the client (Postman, your application, etc) and the API.

Let's use the freely provided (again many thanks to its maintainer) test employee API that we used above.

### Start the proxy

```bash
> specmatic proxy --target http://dummy.restapiexample.com ./contracts
Proxy server is running on http://localhost:9000. Ctrl + C to stop.```
```

Make sure the contracts directory does not exist.

### Generate contracts

Now use Postman to send a request to Specmatic. Create a new Postman request to make a GET request to http://localhost:9000/api/v1/employees

Finally, kill the proxy using Ctrl+C on the command prompt, and it will generate contracts from all the reqeusts and responses it has seen, in the directory that you specify (which is ./contracts in the above example).

You will see something like this:
```bash
Writing contract to ./contracts/new_feature.yaml
Writing stub data to ./contracts/stub0.json
```

Specmatic can identify parameters in URL path based on the traffic passing through it.
For example: If you send two requests, ```/employees/10``` and ```/employees/20```, Specmatic will figure out that URL path should be ```/empoyees/{id}``` where id could be any number, and will add an appropriate path parameter in the specification.

So we recommend making atleast two requests in such cases to provide Specmatic with enough data to idenitify such path parameters.

## From a sample request and response

If you know what the request and response should look like, you can start by creating a file with the sample request and response.

### Create the sample file

The file must contain a single JSON object using the [Specmatic stub file format](/documentation/test_data_format.html).

Here's a sample file that contains a request for the name of a customer by id:

File: customer_stub.json
```json
{
  "http-request": {
    "method": "GET",
    "path": "/customer/name",
    "query": {
      "name": 10
    }
  },
  "http-response": {
    "status": 200,
    "body": "Jane Doe"
  }
}
```

### Convert the sample into a contract

Now run the `specmatic import stub` command on it:

```bash
> specmatic import <stub file>.json
Written to file /Users/xyz/customer_stub.yaml
```

## Importing a Postman collection

This is useful when you have a Postman collection which you use to test your service. Well now you can also convert that collection into a contract.

### Export the collection

First you must [export the collection to a file](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/#exporting-postman-data). Use v2.1 when doing so.

Here's a sample Postman collection that you can use:

File: employee_postman_collection.json
```json
{
        "info": {
                "_postman_id": "042689b4-61dc-4697-85e6-72d47adc0678",
                "name": "Free Test API",
                "schema": "https://schema.getpostman.com/json/collection/v2.1.0/collection.json"
        },
        "item": [
                {
                        "name": "Employee data",
                        "request": {
                                "method": "GET",
                                "header": [],
                                "url": {
                                        "raw": "http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees",
                                        "protocol": "http",
                                        "host": [
                                                "dummy",
                                                "restapiexample",
                                                "com"
                                        ],
                                        "path": [
                                                "api",
                                                "v1",
                                                "employees"
                                        ]
                                }
                        },
                        "response": []
                }
        ],
        "protocolProfileBehavior": {}
}
```

### Generate the contract

```bash
> specmatic import <postman collection file>.json
```
_*Note:*_ The file name should end with `postman_collection.json` like `employee_postman_collection.json`.

This command will read the Postman collection, and write the new specmatic file into "specmatic file.json" as specified in the command.

### Authenticated APIs in Postman

If any of the APIs in the Postman collection require authentication, Specmatic will not be able to invoke them directly with the needed credentials.

Instead, from within Postman, plug in the required credentials, invoke the API, and save the request and response as an example.

Then export the collection, and import it into Specmatic.

Specmatic will still fail to invoke the API, but it will see and convert the examples. You can then adjust the contract as needed.
