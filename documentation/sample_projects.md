## Overview

Specmatic unlocks a new way to approach microservices by aligning contracts and code, making your systems reliable and resilient. Our sample projects showcase real-world implementations across various technologies and communication protocols. This is your playground to experience Specmatic.

### Sample Application Architecture

Each sample project is designed around a familiar microservices setup, giving you the clarity and confidence to integrate Specmatic seamlessly into your stack.

The architecture consists of three core components:

- **Frontend Application** – Where the user interacts.
- **BFF (Backend For Frontend)** – A mediator between the frontend and backend services.
- **Backend Service** – The system's engine, processing and providing data.

### Getting Started
1. Choose a sample project that matches your tech stack
2. Clone the repository and follow the README instructions
3. Explore the contract tests and implementation details
4. Run the examples locally to see Specmatic in action

### Learning Path
- Start with the OpenAPI examples if you're new to Specmatic
- Progress to more complex implementations like OAuth or event-driven patterns
- Experiment with different language implementations of the same architecture

**Let's dive deeper!**
