Getting started in a hurry
==========================

The quickest way to get started is with the command line approach.

### Setup command line

Refer to [command line setup](/documentation/setup_command_line.html) page.

### Author a contract

Refer to [authoring a contract](/documentation/authoring_contract_introduction.html) page.

### Contract As A Stub

All you need at this point is the above qontract file and the jar file which you built (and optionally aliased). You can spin up a stuck server with these two ingredients.

    qontract stub --path=".. ../petstore/qontract/service.qontract" \
                    --host="localhost" \
                    --port="8000" \
               start

The command has defaults and necessary help to guide you through.

Once the stub server is running you can verify the API by accessing it through Postmane, Chrome, Curl etc. to see the response.

    curl http://localhost:8000/pets/123

The response will contain some auto-generate value that adhere to the datatypes defined in the contract. At this point you are ready to start consumer development with this stub server.

### Contract as a Test

Now lets start building the provider. Say suppose you have an empty provider API running at port 8000, we just need to point the contract as test command to it.

    qontract test --path=".. ../petstore/contract/service.qontract" \
                            --host="localhost" \
                            --port="8000" \
               run

This command will give a xunit like feedback about each scenario and what parts of the contract your provider is not satisfying.

    Scenario: Should be able to get a pet by petId url parameter GET /pets/(petid:number) FAILED
    Reason: Response did not match
    	    Expected: 200 Actual: 400
    	Request: {path=/pets/180, method=GET, headers={Content-Type=text/plain}, body=}
    	Response: {"status":400,"status-text":"Bad Request","headers":{"Content-Length":"231","Content-Type":"application/json"}}
    
    Tests run: 1, Failures: 1

As you can see it has rightly pointed out that we have not implemented the "/pets" endpoint. Once you build it the errors will disappear.
This is quite similar to how we start with a feature file in BDD and then let it drive development.

Note: The petid "180" is generated by qontract in above example and will vary with every execution. If you would like to control the value that is being generated please refer to [suggestions](/documentation/suggestions.html).
