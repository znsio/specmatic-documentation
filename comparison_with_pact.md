# Comparison with Pact.io and Pactflow.io

|                                   | [Specmatic.in](https://specmatic.in/) | [Pact.io](https://pact.io/) | [Pactflow.io](https://pactflow.io/) Paid |
|:----------------------------------|:----------------------|:-----------------|:-----------------|
| **Approach**                      | [Contract Driven Development](https://specmatic.in/) (CDD) | [Code First, Consumer Driven Contract Testing](https://docs.pact.io/#consumer-driven-contracts) | [Bi-Directional Contract Testing](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/) (BDCT) |
| **OpenAPI Support** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> [OpenAPIs and Pact are designed with different ends in mind](https://docs.pact.io/faq/convinceme#but-i-use-swaggeropenapi) | <span style="color:orange">**PARTIAL**</span> , only supports [OAS as Provider Spec](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/#use-cases)), [Several Limitations](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/contracts/oas/#considerations) - No Remote Refs / Single document approach, Need to dereference "$Ref", and more |
| **Suitable for Consumer First Development Style** (Frontend Before Backend) | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Consumer Team can author the API Specification, leverage it as mock / stub and then share it with Provider team as a guideline | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Pact requires starting with Consumer development first by mocking the Provider and then leveraging these mocks to generate the Contract for the Provider | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> same as Pact OSS |
| **Suitable for Provider First Development Style** (Backend Before Frontend, public facing APIs, ec.) | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Provider Team can author the API Specification, leverage as tests and then share it with Consumer team to stub the Provider | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Pact is better suited for Consumer First Development Style | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Provider has to publish their OAS to PactFlow server, they will only get feedback after Consumer has publish their Contract and PactFlow has completed Cross Contract Verification |
| **Suitable for API First Development Style** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Consumer and Provider Teams collaboratively author API Specification and only then being development | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> It does not support Contract / API Spec first Development Style | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Consumers still cannot use the API Specification as Stub, they will only have to Cross Contract validate with the Specification |
| **Parallel Development of Consumer and Provider** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> This is one of the primary capabilities of Specmatic, to allow teams to independently develop and confidently deploy microservices | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Consumer development has to be ahead of Provider development | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> |
| **Backward Compatibility Verification #NOCODE** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> This is one of the flagship capabilities in Specmatic. Contract vs Contract comparison, no need to implement the changes in Provider or Consumer Code | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Compatibility can only be possibly detected after an actual change happens in Provider code, two version of Pact JSONs cannot be compared to see if the changes are compatible | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Same as Pact OSS |
| **API Specifications as Test #NOCODE** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Specmatic can generate and run tests, both happy path and boundary conditions, all with just your OpenAPI specifications | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Pact JSONs are the ones that are run as test, OpenAPI cannot be run as tests | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> WITH CAVEAT - External Tool Dependency with Bring Your Own testing tool such as Dredd - Also [several limitations / considerations](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/contracts/oas/#considerations) |
| **API Specifications as Stub #NOCODE** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> OpenAPI is all you need to run a stub server, no need to define a stub, just the expectation data | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Pact DSL necessary to define Stubs | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> When leveraging Bring Your Own mocks, the frameworks such as Mountebank, Wiremock, etc. have to be setup |
| **Smart Mocks** (Stale Stub Detection / Expectation Validation against API Specification) | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Immediate Feedback, expectations that are not as per API Spec are immediately rejected with proper error message | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> / Not Applicable. Contracts are generated based on the expectation, stale stub detection can only happen when pact json is run as test against Provider | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> / Not Applicable. PactFlow allows Bring Your Own (BYO) mocks, even with Mountebank the approach has no immediate verification of stub data with Specification. [Mountebank imposters have to be converted to Pact Files](https://github.com/pactflow/example-bi-directional-consumer-mountebank/blob/1c42e27129c173ce5855a62941860ef1a466f210/test/mountebank.js#L6) which are then uploaded to PactFlow where it is compared with Provider's OAS. Almost 3 levels of indirection before you know whether the stubs are stale. |
| **Unfragmented Devex / Minimal learning curve** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> You just need API Specification of your choice such as OpenAPI and Specmatic - No additional DSLs | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Need to pick up several tools to achieve a basic level of coverage - Pact, Pact DSL for Mocking, Pact Broker, API Specification such as OpenAPI, Tool to run API Specification as Test. Has [significant learning curve](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/#trade-offs). | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> The Bring Your Own tools approach adds to the list of Pact OSS - PactFlow, Pact DSL for Mocking AND / OR other tools like Mountebank, API Specification such as OpenAPI, Ready API, Dredd, etc. to run API Specification as Test, PactFlow Broker Server. If teams within an organization are leveraging a mix and match of these tools that makes it hard for people to move across teams. |
| **Can all stakeholders participate / author Contracts / API Specifications** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Devs, architects, test engineers, practically anyone who can author an OpenAPI Spec. | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> [Developer/SDET](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/#when-to-use) only because they have to generate to Pact JSON / Contract only after they have written a mock with Pact DSL | <span style="color:orange">**PARTIAL**</span>  Only Provider Spec / OAS can be written by anyone. Consumer Contract has to be written / generated by Consumer Developer / Testers. |
| **Suitable for adoption in Greenfield Projects** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Specmatic helps team become productive quickly with Contract Driven Development | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Better suited for "[Retrofitting contract-tests onto existing systems](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/#trade-offs)" |
| **Suitable for adoption in Brownfield Projects** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Specmatic can immediately provide value on existing projects and helps the team slowly adopt Contract Driven Development | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Better suited for "[Greenfield projects](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/#when-to-use)" | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> WITH CAVEAT - [Involves Guarantee Tradeoffs](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/#trade-offs) |
| **Minimal / No Leakage for Compatibility Issues** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Specmatic keeps a tight check on both the Consumer and Provider and immediately provides feedback where they deviate from API Specification thereby preventing compatibility Issues | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> While Code First, Consumer Driven Contract has a narrow set of use cases where it is suitable, within that narrow area it is able to prevent / reduce compatibility issues. | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> [BiDirectional Contract Testing has lower guarantees](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/#trade-offs) in comparison to Consumer Driven Contract / Pact OSS |
| **Low Cost of Maintenance** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Since Specmatic is leveraging your API Specifications there is no maintenance overhead. You just need to maintain your Stub / Expectation data. | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> In comparison to Specmatic which only needs API Specifications, you need to maintain the Pact JSONs. | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> [Has higher cost of maintenance in comparison with Pact OSS](https://docs.pactflow.io/docs/bi-directional-contract-testing/#trade-offs) |
| **Open Source** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> License - MIT | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> - Involves Proprietary Code |
| **Language and Platform Agnostic** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Is able to work completely as a standalone executable | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Pact DSL is language specific. While Pact supports several languages, if your language is not supported, you will have to try [alternate approaches](https://docs.pact.io/implementation_guides/other_languages). | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> WITH CAVEAT - With Bring Your Own Tools approach this should be possible, however it comes at additional effort. Example: If you are using Mountebank instead of Pact Mocking, imposters have to be converted to Pact Files |
| **Unlimited Team Size** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Team sizes vary based on the Pricing Plan |
| **Broker Less** | <span style="color:green">**YES**</span> Requires no server setup | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> Pact Broker has to be run on a server where Pacts are uploaded, requires [maintenance](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/administration/maintenance). | <span style="color:red">**NO**</span> PactFlow involves cloud based Pact Broker, on-prem options seem to be available with enterprise pricing plan |
