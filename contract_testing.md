### Context

With an increasing number of applications moving to MicroServices / Distributed Architecture, it is becoming increasingly hard to run all dependencies on a single machine as a Developer.

There have been several tools and techniques that have been tried over time to solve this. Examples:
* Record and Replay - When there were no tools to help stub other service dependencies the go to approach was to use tools like Fiddler to record and replay requests. It worked, just that it was not convenient to store these recordings in version control. Just a trick up a developer’s sleeve to move fast while developing client applications.
* [Self Initializing Fakes](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SelfInitializingFake.html) - In Rails community VCR was a popular technique to record the interaction where the consumer calls the provider and then store the request and response of that interaction as a cassette which can be played back to the consumer should there be more such requests while running unit tests. The main downside to this approach is that the Consumer does not have any way of knowing that the provider has changed its API signature and that the cassettes are not valid any more.
* WireMock - This tool did what it advertised well. Lets you author the mock server yourself instead of recording the interaction. However there is no way to say whether the mock is truly representing the provider.

The main downside to above techniques is that the provider stub may not be inline with the provider. So Integration Tests are necessary to identify issues.

However **Integration Testing is not an option** given the expense (cost and time) and effort involved in building and maintaining a comprehensive suite.

### Enter Contract Testing

Contract Tests keep the test double which used by the consumer in line with the provider and vice versa. Thereby reducing the need for a Integration Tests.

Before picking a Contract Testing tool, it is important to consider your Development Style.
* FrontEnd before BackEnd - [Consumer Driven Contract](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html)
  * In this style consumers (UI, Applications) write Test Doubles for Providers because the Provider API does not exist.
  * A contract is generated based on these Test Doubles and shared with the Provider API Team
  * Now it is the responsibility of the Provider API team to make sure they honor this contract
* API First - Provider Driven Contract
  * The Provider API Team write tests against their application
  * These tests generate a test Double or Fake which is shared with Consumer Teams.
  * Consumers use these Test Doubles / Fakes during development and testing to avoid expensive calls to the real Provider

It is not easy to pick on approach. Some use cases require an API First approach and others not. So usually we will have a mix of these techniques.

Qontract being an [Contract First](http://localhost:4000/#what-is-contract-first) suits both development styles seamlessly.
