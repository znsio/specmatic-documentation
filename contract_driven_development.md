**Contract Driven Development** leverages API Specifications (such as [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)) as Executable Contracts to shift-left the contract compatibility issue identification.

At a high level, our goal is to
* Significantly improve time to market for features
* Independently develop and deploy microservices and microfrontends
* Drastically reduce the dependency on integration testing
* Foster better API designs and collaboration between teams by facilitating communication through industry standard API Specifications such as OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, etc.
