### What is "Contract First"?
Contract Testing involves two sides, Consumer and Provider. Contract Testing Tools usually have to pick a side that will define the contracts.
* **Consumer Driven Contracts** - The contract is generated based on the Provider Stub / Mock server that is defined by Consumers.
* **Provider Driven Contracts** - The contract is more or less a Provider API test. This test / contract generates the Provider Stub / Mock server that is used by Consumers.

We believe both "Consumer First" and "Provider" approaches have their place in application architecture and did not want to impose either technique on developers.

So we decided on **Contract First** approach. This reduces bias towards Provider or Consumer in API Design.

### Key Features

* **Human readable contracts** - Qontract leverages **Gherkin**'s strength as a specification mechanism to define APIs.
* **Backward Compatibility Verification** - Contract vs Contract testing (cross version compatibility checks) etc.
* **Contract as Stub / Mock** - Run stubs / mocks that are based on your downstream contracts to isolate your development
* **Contract as Test** - Test drive your APIs with contract
* **Programmatic** (Kotlin, Java and JVM languages) **and Command line support**
* [**And many more**](/features.html)
